## About The Project

Fractals have always captivated me with their infinite complexity and stunning visuals. Inspired by this fascination, I decided to develop a program that leverages the power of fractals to generate unique 2D mountain landscapes. Starting with a simple triangle, the program recursively subdivides it into smaller triangles, introducing randomized perturbations to the vertices to simulate natural mountainous terrains.

### Built With
